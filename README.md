## 🚀 Game Features

- **Start Game / Restart Game Buttons**  
  Players can begin the game with a single click. Restarting resets the timer and score, and pressing restart mid-game returns the game to its initial state.

- **Score System**  
  Each circle awards a different number of points based on its type. A points legend box is displayed for clarity.

- **Power-Ups**  
  Special colored circles provide boosts such as extra time, bonus points, or slowed-down motion.

- **Timer-Based Challenge**  
  Players must score as many points as possible before the timer runs out. Once the timer hits zero, the game ends automatically.

- **Authentication Logic**  
  The game can be linked to an account system so that only logged-in users can start a game. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.

- **Responsive Buttons**  
  - The **Restart Game** button only appears during gameplay.  
  - The **Start Game** button is shown when no game is active.

- **Dynamic Circle Generation**  
  Circles randomly appear in different sizes, positions, and with varying effects, keeping gameplay engaging.
